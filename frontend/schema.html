        <h1 class="title">Core Database Schema</h1>
        <p>
            A rich dataset can be constructed around virus nucleotide data. The data 
            within a V-gDB project is structured according to the Core Schema; a fixed set of object types and 
            relationships.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The V-gDB database is generated using the Viral Genome Toolkit. 
        </p>

        <h2>Meta_data</h2>
        <p>The meta_data table stores descriptive information about each sequence, identified by the NCBI primary_accession
            number. It contains sequence information such as length, clade assignment, strain. It also contains sample details
            such as isolate_id, host species, and country of origin. 
        </p>

        <h2>Sequences</h2>
        <p>The sequences table contains the NCBI primary_accession number and the associated unaligned sequece.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
            The features table contains the coordinates of each feature in the aligned sequence 
            with regards to its aligned reference sequence.

            <ul>
                <li>The <b>cds_start</b> and <b>cds_end</b> are the coordinates of the feature.</li>
                <li>The <b>aln_start</b> and <b>aln_end</b> are the coordinates of the entire aligned sequence. </li>
            </ul>

            
        </p>

        <h2>Sequence_alignment</h2>
        <p>
            The sequence_alignment table contains the NCBI primary accession of the sequence and its reference sequence
            and the aligned sequence. 

            The aligned sequence does not include the insertions. See the insertions table for this information. 
        </p>

        <h2>Insertions</h2>
        <p>
            The insertions table contains the NCBI primary_accession of the sequence and reference and a comma seperated
            list of the starting nucleotide position and the insertions at that spot.
        </p>
